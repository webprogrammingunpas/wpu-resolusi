Hi! I'm jack in my cybername, I'm 22 years old. I'm not in any colleges and my last study is High School. This file is just my practical file. Thanks for your free course anyway and I really appreciate it.

These are my resolution:
1. Find my true teammate.
2. Create a Website with my teammate.
3. Share everything with my teammate.
4. Become a good Developer.
5. Have a couple of expertise.
