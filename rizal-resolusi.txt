Hi my name Rizal Fathurrahman from Gresik, East Java

Here is about my dream :
Now i'm one of the students from cloud computing path learning in Bangkit Academy 2021 and exploring a lot of things bout cloud

- i put more curious about cloud but i think i'll be able more to understand in Indonesian languange
- i'm looking for associate cloud engineer certification right now in this program hopefully i can pursue it with the best
- i really enjoy with html, css, javascript (but i still less more in this) so i hope there will be more knowledge that you share about html.
